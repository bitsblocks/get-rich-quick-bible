Q: Savedroid Initial Coin Offering (ICO): What the tokens will be used for?

> A key question that everyone should ask before buying into an ICO is:
> what will the tokens be used for? In the case of savedroid,
> the token will become the key payment in the new crypto ecosystem of the company - 
> and therefore has good chances to show a strong performance if savedroid’s crypto simplification strategy works:


![](i/savedroid-magic.png)

> The savedroid token (SVD) is a utility token and will be used to purchase the crypto services within the savedroid ecosystem.
> Users of savedroid's automated crypto saving and investing will have to use the savedroid token to pay the fees of these crypto
> services. It has a built-in deflation mechanism to support its future value.
> Users can buy or sell the SVD in supported token exchanges.

> Within savedroid's unique [self-learning secret-sauce black-box] artificial intelligence (AI) fueled ecosystem,
> users will profit from convenient crypto saving plans and superior crypto investment opportunities,
> such as portfolios, derivatives, and ICOs.
> savedroid will conveniently auto-convert savings to cryptocurrencies,
> securely store them, and make them easily accessible, tradeable, and spendable.
> We will offer all of these crypto services for a reasonable fee in savedroid (SVD) tokens.
>
> **When a user takes his savedroid tokens to pay for a crypto service, we collect his savedroid tokens and automatically burn a
> percentage of these tokens. Thus, the number of available savedroid tokens will decrease over time.
> The bottom line is that this will support the future value of the savedroid token.**
>
> In other words, a percentage of the savedroid crypto service fees will automatically be removed from the pool of available SVDs
> by every single purchase. Thus, the more the savedroid ecosystem is used, the further the supply of SVD will decrease.
>
> So, eventually, our user growth will drive an increasing demand for savedroid tokens on the one hand and, at the same time,
> a decreasing supply of savedroid tokens on the other hand.
> Hence, the value of the savedroid token depends, among other factors, on our future user growth of greater fools
> [Thanks for the free money and HODLing the bag!].
